//I have seen this String interview question on many interviews. It has an easy recursive solution but things get really tricky when Interviewer asks you to solve this question without using recursion. You can use a Stack though. Write a program to print all permutations of a String in Java, for example, the if input is "xyz" then it should print "xyz", "yzx", "zxy", "xzy", "yxz", "zyx".
